    "# Practical 1: Unsupervised learning and AI Peer-Programming\n",
    "Our first lecture introduced us to the different types of machine learning, their use cases, and underlying data structures. Given that the course focuses on supervised learning, we use this introductory practice session and shed, at least, some light on *unsupervised learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we use this notebook to illustrate the capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI). More specifically, we examine how GenAI (e.g., ChatGPT), can help us develop Python codes. To that end, the notebook provides a set of prompts to generate Python codes. Your task is to try out these prompts using an AI of your choice and experiment with the generated programming codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest you begin with the prepared prompts. Afterwards, you are most welcome to make adjustments and examine how changes in your prompts change the generated codes; and by extension the effectiveness of the GenAI support. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer** Prompts were tested with different versions of ChatGTP and should work reasonably well. That said, there is no guarantee that the provided prompts lead an AI to produce ready-to-use code. As said, one learning goal of this session is to *study how GenAI can help us*. We should not expect it to do all the work.\n",
